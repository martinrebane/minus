# Minus technique

Straightforward, mostly unoptimized implementation of Leo VÃµhandu's minus technique in R. Minus technique is an algorithm for reordering data tables according to data object's (row) conformity (placing similar chunks of data together).

Original Estonian name for the method is "miinustehnika".
